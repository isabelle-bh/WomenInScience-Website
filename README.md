# wis

## HOW TO RUN:

1. clone this repository locally
2. open in code editor (eg. vscode)
3. terminal: cd wisreactapp
4. terminal: node -v
5. if node version is not 20.9.0, install nvm and switch to this version / LTS
6. terminal: npm install
7. terminal: npm start
8. NEEDS TO BE FIXED BUT FOR NOW: change url from localhost:3000/wis to localhost:3000/wis/wisreactapp to view CSS (change 3000 to whatever your port is)
